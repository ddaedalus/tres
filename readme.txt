1. Create 2 files in the "files" directory: (a) seeds.txt with the seed URLs that the crawler would start its process and (b) data.txt providing relevant URLs (around 800-1000 at most) for training KwBiLSTM
2. RUN python3 read_data.py
3. INSERT your keywords in taxonomy.py
4. RUN python3 keyword_extract.py
5. RUN python3 run_classification.py
6. RUN python3 run_crawling.py

Enjoy your crawl!
